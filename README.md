###Blogalicious

This was a practice app I did over the weekend to go through the steps of putting a MEAN Stack together!  As my original project did not really turnout at all, I decided to fall back on this one.  It's a blogging app that allows you to log in with either Admin or User permissions.

####Technologies used:
* MongoDB - Database
* Express - Routing and set up
* Angular.js - Front End development
* Node.JS - Backend set up
* Passport - Authentication

####Installation Instructions:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/SeaPyp/blogalicous2
$ npm install
$ node server
```
Make sure to run `mongod` or `sudo mongod` in a separate terminal window for the database.

Issues Encountered:
3 Party API's and OAuth - managed to overcome some, lost some others.
Time management - thought I could spend more time on things that I wanted to instead of what I needed to do.
